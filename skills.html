            Before starting the class, I had no experience with HTML or CSS. The only experience that I 
            had with coding was the classes I took with Oracle during the Intersessions in Freshman 
            year.

            I think that the best skills that I had coming into the class was my knowledge of computers in general. More
            specifically navigating a computer. I have been using computers my entire life, so when I was introduced to 
            new applications and just new tech in general, I feel like I picked it up very easily.
